On June 27, 2014, The Crystal Ships released their debut album, The Tide. The Tide is fun, bright and easy to dance to, with surprising musical and lyrical depth. The Tide employs many techniques from art music, especially electroacoustic music. It features songs with unique forms, time signature changes, and chromatic harmonies, which are used regularly in art music, but rarely in pop. It also borrows from musique concrete, using environmental sounds as musical material. Young, charismatic, and inventive, The Crystal Ships is a band to look out for.
