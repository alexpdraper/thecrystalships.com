  <summary>The Beginning and the End</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      I will sail across the sea<br>
      To find the answers that I seek<br>
      To find the truth out in the deep
    </p>
    <p>
      Leave behind both friends and home<br>
      Sail into the world unknown<br>
      Live the life I’ve longed to know
    </p>
  </div>

  <summary>The Tide</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      I was born by the sea<br>
      Ocean air in my lungs and the tide at my feet<br>
      And the tide calls to me<br>
      To sail out into the deep
    </p>
    <p>
      And if I fall into the deep<br>
      I’m coming home the tide will carry me<br>
      The tide will carry me home
    </p>
    <p>
      Lullabies and your eyes<br>
      Are calling me home and I can’t ignore<br>
      The denial that I saw in your smile<br>
      When I set out into the unknown
    </p>
  </div>

<details class="track-listing">
  <summary>Stories</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      There is a story that you hold<br>
      that is waiting to be told<br>
      out on the sea away from home in a world you don’t know
    </p>
    <p>
      Close your eyes and realize<br>
      Now is the time to be alive<br>
      All you’ve seen and all you know<br>
      Are only stories you’ve been told<br>
      So go chase a world of your own<br>
      And watch your story unfold
    </p>

  <summary>Lost</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      There’s gotta be something for me in the world out there<br>
      if only I could get past my doorstep<br>
      I had never heard the call of the world beyond the shore<br>
      but your words spoke to me and now my heart yearns for more
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s more than what I know, and<br>
      I’ll be lost till I find you
    </p>
    <p>
      I know there are answers out there for me to find<br>
      I will sail the ocean blue to find the truth
    </p>
    <p>
      I know I’m lost in a world alone<br>
      I will be lost until I find my home

  <summary>Dangers of the Deep</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      They were sure you did not exist<br>
      You were just a legend and a myth<br>
      A little white lie mothers told their kids<br>
      To keep them safe from the dangers of the deep
    </p>
    <p>
      Until the day you made history<br>
      When you washed up on the beach<br>
      And unravelled a mystery<br>
      What lies beneath? What’s hiding in the deep?

  <summary>Wish I Had Known You</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      Through the fog I can see<br>
      The light as it breaks through to me<br>
      In the cold we are clenching our teeth<br>
      We feel the mist off the see<br>
      And with each passing wave<br>
      I clench my teeth tighter again<br>
      And ponder the change the sea tends to make<br>
      With each passing day and each passing wave
    </p>
    <p>
      Wish I had known, wish that I had really know you<br>
      The way I should have known you
    </p>
    <p>
      The ocean breeze<br>
      It seems to speak to me<br>
      I feel I’m getting closer
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve crossed the sea to know your heart<br>
      And I know I’m not that far<br>
      I know the way you lived your life<br>
      And I know I want to live mine

  <summary>The Storm</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      I feel the rain on my skin<br>
      As the darkness closes in<br>
      And the waves pull me down<br>
      I’m getting closer now
    </p>
    <p>
      Do your best to make it home tonight

  <summary>Crossing the Bar</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      I’ll keep trying to keep my head above the water<br>
      As long as you keep holding on<br>
      I’ll keep fighting for as long as I have strength left<br>
      But I doubt that I’ll be long
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the deep and onto the stars<br>
      Sing me to sleep when I cross the bar
    </p>
    <p>
      If you love me let me go
    </p>
    <p>
      You and I fought long and hard we fought a good fight<br>
      And I am not ashamed<br>
      Of who I am or where I’ve been or where I’m going<br>
      No I am not afraid, as I go
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the deep and onto the stars<br>
      Sing me to sleep when I cross the bar
    </p>
    <p>
      If you love me let me go<br>
      I’ve been longing for my home
    </p>
    <p>
      Look into my eyes<br>
      I just need to hear you say goodbye<br>
      It’s been a long, long night<br>
      I just need to hear you say goodbye<br>
      And good night

  <summary>Ocean Forgets Me</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      Cold and lost in the ocean in a world I’ve come to know<br>
      As this ship sinks into the water and leaves me alone<br>
      Stars break through the clouds and shine down on this last night of my life<br>
      As I fight not to drown, as I fight to survive
    </p>
    <p>
      And the ocean pulls me under<br>
      In its fierce unyielding grasp<br>
      As my future’s torn asunder<br>
      I feel your heart at last
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm rages on after I’m gone<br>
      And the ocean forgets me<br>
      I am calm as the storm rages on<br>
      My story goes on<br>
      And the ocean forgets me
    </p>
    <p>
      And pulls me under<br>
      In its fierce unyielding grasp<br>
      As my future’s torn asunder<br>
      I feel your heart at last<br>
      And the currents pull me deeper<br>
      Into the depths of the sea<br>
      I know my story will continue<br>
      As the ocean forgets me

  <summary>After the End</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      I have a world to hope for<br>
      That I’ve never seen<br>
      But somehow I know<br>
      The ocean waves are guiding me onwards<br>
      To that faroff place<br>
      Where I long to go
    </p>
    <p>
      The ocean held me, took me for its own<br>
      And the tide carried me home<br>
      To the sea of glass and fire that I saw in your life<br>
      When I first felt the tide<br>
      Calling me to go
    </p>
    <p>
      This world is here for the waiting<br>
      And the hopeful<br>
      Out on the sea<br>
      Find your heart in the journey<br>
      Into the ocean<br>
      Into history
    </p>
    <p>
      The songs you sing will never die<br>
      The life you lived keeps you alive<br>
      Your story begins after the end

  <summary>After the End II</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      Late night<br>
      I see your eyes<br>
      Searching for something you won’t find
    </p>
    <p>
      I am creation and destruction<br>
      Both a beginning and an end<br>
      I am creation and destruction<br>
      I will bring you home again
    </p>
    <p>
      So here is hope for every sailor<br>
      Who leaves home in search of more<br>
      I will be there when it’s over<br>
      I’ll bring you home after the war
    </p>
    <p>
      So when you reach your final chapter<br>
      And you round your final bend<br>
      I will meet you at the finish<br>
      I’ll bring you home after the end

  <summary>The End and the Beginning</summary>
  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      In the beginning and the end<br>
      The world goes on without me<br>
      In the beginning and the end<br>
      I ask myself the question<br>
      How will I be remembered?
    </p>
    <p>
      The colours fade<br>
      As the tide takes me away<br>
      The colours fade<br>
      But the memories remain
